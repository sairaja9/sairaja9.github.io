            <div id="bio">
                <p>Back in 2019, I worked on A DARPA-funded research project called Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The goal of the project was to help humans understand how AI decisions were made, and hence facilitate trust and reliability. Over the next few summers, I <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tsAgeXoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">co-authored</a> international conference and journal papers on new frameworks for AI transparency.</p>
                <p>Now, a third year undergraduate at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/colleges/rice-university/?list=top-colleges" target="_blank">Rice University</a>, I've channeled this interest into entrepreneurial ventures. I founded <a href="https://untgl.net/" target="_blank">UNTGL</a> - an AI-powered web-agency that delivers premium websites with unprecedented efficiency. Some of my other ventures include an award-winning carbon portfolio generator featured in <a href="https://devpost.com/software/hexagon-64icwp" target="_blank">HackRice 13</a>.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am working on a new venture that utilizes the up and coming "agentic-AI" approach with XAI-related features. Over the past couple of summers, I have also honed my skills in full-stack web development through an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-k-raja/details/certifications/" target="_blank">IBM certificate</a>, and a DJ-focused party and live music app.</p>
                <p>I enjoy work at the intersection of business and AI, involving both technical and non-technical disciplines. Moving forward, I am seeking a unique role centered around incorporating trustworthy AI into business workflows.</p>
